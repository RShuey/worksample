#Black Opal
Black opal was a miniature language that I used as a final project for my Computing II class as Indiana Univsity Purdue University Indianapolis.  This project was never completed, and only has a few functions.  I may end up reviewing it later.  Please reffer to the documentation for more information on how it works.

To compile run "make all".
