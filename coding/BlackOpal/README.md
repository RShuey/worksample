#Black Opal
Black opal was a miniature language that I used as a final project for my Computing II class at Indiana Univsity Purdue University Indianapolis.  This project was completed, but it only has a few functions.  I may end up remaking it later.  Please reffer to the documentation for more information on how it works.

To compile run "make all" in your shell.  Last tested on oct. 9th 2016 on a debian machine.
