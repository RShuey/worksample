#Problem Generator

This project was created for my computing 1 class at IUPUI.  This generates math problems that can be put into a test.  The program is modular, and more problem types can be added in the /plugs/ folder.

To start this program, run "python3 ux.py" in your terminal, DO NOT RUN MAIN.

For more information, see the documentation "a fools guide to a fools program.odt".
